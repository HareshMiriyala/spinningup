Welcome to Floating Up in Deep RL! 
==================================

This is a fork of OpenAI's spinningUp in RL, but implemented in PyTorch instead of Tensorflow. I give all credits to https://github.com/kashif/firedup for their first implementation in PyTorch, from which this repository is cloned and improved upon. 

Some extensions : added Beta policy for VPG. Everything is Under development, so only use this repo to learn about PG algorithms. 

This repository serves as a educational tool for me to implement different policy gradient techniques , as well as switch from Tensorflow to PyTorch.
